# TraktSharp

A C# wrapper around Trakt API (currently supporting version 2 of the API). This project is not affiliated in any way with the devs over at Trakt - please do not contact them for support with this library.

The project is near feature-complete in terms of API coverage and all methods have been tested to some extent. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

The easiest way to learn how to use TraktSharp is to clone the source and fire up the `TraktSharp.Examples.Wpf` project. This project contains a fairly feature-complete demo of all the features of the solution.

More documentation to come at some point...

## Requirements

To use this Library, your platform must support .NET Standard 1.4.
